# HammerSpace
## General Info

HammerSpace is an N-tier ASP.NET MVC Web App which was developed for the sole purpose of allowing a User to have a digitized collection of all of their games and movies, with books and potentially more additions in the future. Developed by Evan Lacy as a independent project for the Red Badge of Eleven Fifty's Software Development Course, it is the summation of all the knowledge gained over the course of the previous three months. Included here are links and references to the various preparatory documentation made in support of this project.
